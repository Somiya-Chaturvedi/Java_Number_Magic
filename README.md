 Java_Number_Magic

Hi! ğŸ‘‹ I'm just starting my coding journey, and this is my first mini Java project. It's a simple collection of number-based programs I built to learn loops and logic.

 ğŸ”¢ Programs:
- Reverse a number
- Sum of digits
- Armstrong number
- Palindrome check
- Digit count

Built with ğŸ’› using Java basics.  
More coming soon as I keep learning!
